AniDex requires an AniList.co account for list tracking and personalization features, but offers extensive browsing and discovery capabilities without signing in — making it the most accessible AniList client available. AniList is a free service for tracking, sharing, and discovering anime and manga. AniDex will also operate as a free service as long as AniList's services and APIs remain free.

AniDex is an unofficial third-party client and is not affiliated with AniList.co. This app is for tracking and discovery purposes and does not provide capabilities for streaming anime or reading manga content.
